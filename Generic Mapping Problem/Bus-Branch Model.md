A network model in which nodes correspond to buses and edges correspond to branches. It is common to store auxiliary data (e.g., electrical properties) with each node and with each branch.

Confer with [[Node-Breaker Model]], which distinguishes circuit breakers from the buses within which they are contained.
### Network Topology Processing
A bus-breaker model can be transformed into a bus-branch model through amalgamation.
