A network model in which nodes correspond to buses and/or breakers and edges correspond to branches. It is common to store auxiliary data (e.g., electrical properties) with each node and with each branch.

Note: sometimes the equivalent term *bus-breaker model* is used.

Confer with [[Bus-Branch Model]], which amalgamates circuit breakers into the buses with which they are associated.
### Network Topology Processing
A node-breaker model can be transformed into a bus-branch model through amalgamation.
