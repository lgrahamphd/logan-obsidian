The Conastone-Otter Creek 230 kV line has a lengthy outage scheduled from fall 2025 through early summer 2026. Given the line's critical importance to North-to-South flows from PPL to BGE, we completed a deep dive into the nature of the outage.

### Key Points
Conastone-Otter Creek is being reconductored, as the towers are wrecked and rebuilt to support a 230 kV, 500 kV double circuit. It will be out of service for the duration of the outage, so it is not possible to bring it back online during acute situations while the outage is taking place.

PJM's 2023 RTEP states that Otter Creek-Conastone is to become a double circuit involving the present 230 kV line in addition to a greenfield 500 kV line from Otter Creek (Collinsville) to Doubs. The TMI-Peach Bottom 500 kV line will be tapped, and a 500 kV substation (Otter Creek) will be built as a result.

With this new Otter Creek-Conastone 500 kV line, there will exist a 500 kV path from the new TMI/Peach Bottom tap to Conastone. Before this, the only 500 kV path accommodating North-to-South flows was Peach Bottom-Conastone (the Hunterstown-Conastone 500 kV line accommodates flows from the West/Northwest into Conastone).

The below tickets are associated with upgrades made to the 230 kV line as part of the project to construct this double circuit.

### RTEP
**Project:** [[B3800]]
**Proposal:** PPL Proposal 374, PJM RTEP 2022 Window 3

PJM's 2023 RTEP (the most recent) lists (sub)-project B3800.3 as follows:
	Build New Otter Creek (Collinsville) to Doubs 500 kV line (Otter Creek 500 kV - MD Border). Rebuild and expand existing ~12 miles of Otter Creek-Conastone 230 kV line to become a double-circuit 500 and 230 kV lines.

### History
On 3/10/2021, a 30-day outage was planned for 5/2/2023-5/31/2023 on CNS-OTT 1 (ticket 938105). The description was "Repair/Replace: Conductor, Construction: New Equipment." This ticket was canceled on 3/29/2022, so the outage never took place.

### Coincident Outages
Conastone-Peach Bottom (500 kV line; CNS-PEA 1) is scheduled to be out for re-insulation 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-14. This looks to be RTEP (sub)-project B3800.35:
	Rebuild 5012 (existing Peach Bottom-Conastone) (new North Delta-Graceton PECO) 500 kV line on single circuit structures within existing right of way and cut into North Delta 500 kV and Graceton 500 kV stations.
