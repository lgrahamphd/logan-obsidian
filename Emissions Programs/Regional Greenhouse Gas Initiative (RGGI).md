**RGGI** is a cooperative effort among northeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. states to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a **cap-and-trade program**. It specifically targets **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** emissions from the power sector. For a power trader, understanding RGGI’s allowance market is key to managing costs and capitalizing on trading opportunities.

## Key Points of Interest for Traders:
- **Allowance Markets**: Power plants must hold **CO₂ allowances** for each ton of CO₂ they emit. These allowances can be **bought, sold, or traded** in RGGI’s market. Price fluctuations create opportunities to **hedge**, **speculate**, or optimize the cost of emissions compliance.
- **Quarterly Auctions**: RGGI conducts **quarterly auctions** where allowances are sold. Monitoring auction results and secondary market prices can help identify trading opportunities.
- **Emission Caps**: RGGI states set a declining cap on total CO₂ emissions, which decreases over time, tightening the supply of allowances and potentially driving up prices. Power plants can invest in **cleaner technologies** to reduce their need for allowances or participate actively in the market to offset excess emissions.

- Those against Pennsylvania's participation in RGGI sued & received an injunction until the case could be decided.
- [The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court found that RGGI was an unconstitutional tax and ruled compliance could not be pursued (permanently enjoined enforcement)](https://url.avanan.click/v2/r01/___https:/icapcarbonaction.com/en/news/update-pennsylvania-court-rules-against-rggi-link-government-appeals%23:~:text=The%20original%20article%20was%20published,state%20from%20participating%20in%20RGGI.___.YXAzOnJvc2NvbW1vbmFuYWx5dGljczphOm86ZDFiYjdjNjUyNTY1NmExNGJlMDhhMjk3ZmU0M2U0ZDQ6Nzo5YWQ4OjZkZjU2NGJkNTA5MjUzYzJjZmQ5YTI1YWIxNjYyZTZjY2I3ZTI4ZmE0YzQ2MDg2MzYyZjIzNjFiMGNhMmJhZjk6aDpUOk4 "https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news/update-pennsylvania-court-rules-against-rggi-link-government-appeals#:~:text=The%20original%20article%20was%20published,state%20from%20participating%20in%20RGGI.")
