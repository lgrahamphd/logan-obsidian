**CSAPR** regulates emissions of **SO$_2$** and **NO$_x$** from power plants, which contribute to downwind air quality issues. For a power trader, CSAPR introduces a **cap-and-trade system**, where **allowances** are critical for compliance. Power plants are required to hold enough allowances to cover their emissions during specific periods. The market for these allowances creates trading opportunities, impacting both compliance strategies and profit maximization.

#### Key Points of Interest for Traders:
- **Allowance Markets**: CSAPR allows for the **buying, selling, and trading** of emission allowances (SO$_2$ and NO$_x$). Understanding **supply and demand** dynamics in this market is crucial, as plants can purchase excess allowances to avoid penalties or sell surplus allowances for profit.
- **Cap-and-Trade Flexibility**: Power plants that reduce emissions can **bank** or **sell** allowances, while those exceeding their limits must buy allowances. This presents trading opportunities, especially during price fluctuations due to **seasonal demand**, **regulatory changes**, or **energy consumption trends**.
- **Emission Caps**: The EPA sets state-specific emissions budgets, and plants must comply either by reducing emissions or procuring allowances. Monitoring **trading activity** in the market is essential to optimize cost-efficiency and position strategically.
#### Summary of CSAPR Groups:
| **Aspect**         | **Group 1 (SO$_2$ Annual)**             | **Group 2 (NO$_x$ Annual)**             | **Group 3 (NO$_x$ Ozone Season)**                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pollutant**      | Annual SO$_2$ (PM2.5 precursor)         | Annual NO$_x$ (PM2.5 precursor)         | Seasonal NO$_x$ (O₃ precursor)                           |
| **Time Period**    | Calendar year                           | Calendar year                           | Ozone season (May 1 – Sep 30)                            |
| **Objective**      | Reduce SO$_2$ contributing to PM2.5     | Reduce NO$_x$ contributing to PM2.5     | Reduce NO$_x$ contributing to O₃                         |
| **Allowance Req.** | Based on annual SO$_2$ emissions        | Based on annual NO$_x$ emissions        | Based on ozone-season NO$_x$ emissions                   |
| **Market**         | Separate allowances for Group 1         | Separate allowances for Group 2         | Separate allowances for Group 3                          |
| **Applicability**  | States contributing to PM2.5 via SO$_2$ | States contributing to PM2.5 via NO$_x$ | States contributing to O₃ via NO$_x$ during ozone season |
