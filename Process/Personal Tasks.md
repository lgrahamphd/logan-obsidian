## Key Points
- Working with and learning from the right mentor is my top priority.
- I see a clear disconnect between time/effort spent on projects and their payoff in terms of informing trading.
- Interested in all ISOs.
- Interested in exploring virtuals or hub trading in addition to FTRs.
## Objectives
- Learn from the best.
- Have skin in the game.
- Cultivate autonomy in my approach.
## Timing
- Wait-and-see period to persist until the dust has settled with respect to the prospective investor.
- Use profitability leverage while it exists. Do not delay.
## Angle
- Play to our strengths; gently mention PnL: resource ratio imbalance
- New resource starting soon -- four reports
- My personal familiarity with J
- Speak with M. Be honest. His advocacy would be sufficient
## ROI
- Approach clearly  falls into the pattern of *Missing the Forest for the Trees*.
- Seems to be only partially interested in trading. As traders, we need to have the killer instinct and passion for pragmatic approaches to modeling, research, and deploying risk under uncertainty. Moreover *killer instinct* is not synonymous with high levels of frustration and a quick temper.
- Production cost model - massive time sink. Would require 2+ well-trained analysts working full-time for this to be useful. 1 year of development so far very much hindered by *analysis paralysis* tendencies.
- During auction week, it's common for nits such as proper regex searching in web apps to be discussed at length.
- Grand ideas and project pitches do not consider the necessary time investment. These also prioritize perfectionism of various forms instead of impact on successful trading policies. The pattern is indicative of a latent mindset in which one first builds the perfect, all-encompassing system, then one starts trading off of it.
