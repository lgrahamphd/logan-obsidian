# New Hire Technical Skills Introduction

In addition to our commercial activities, the team collaborates on shared analytics using a number of different technologies. We use the following regularly in our day-to-day processes, so (re)familiarizing yourself with how they work will make it easier to hit the ground running.

- Python
- Git (Source Control)
- Databases & SQL

# Python

We use Python for the vast majority of our in-house analytics. We currently work in Python 3.9 and 3.11, with some legacy code we're migrating away from still in 2.7.

# Git

We use Git for source control. We are currently hosting our repositories on BitBucket but are considering migrating to GitHub.

# Databases & SQL

We started with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and are migrating to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html). Some of our other tools use Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL). 
For the most part, a basic familiarity with working with SQL queries is all you need to start. 
Understanding database indexing is a more advanced concept but quickly becomes critical when working with large amounts of data.
