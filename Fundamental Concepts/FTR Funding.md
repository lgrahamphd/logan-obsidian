An ISO collects congestion revenue in the day-ahead market from load based on the differences in the congestion component of the LMPs at locations where energy is produced and consumed. The resulting revenue is paid to holders of FTRs.

*If the FTRs issued by the ISO are physically feasible, meaning that network flows sold as FTRs do not exceed flows scheduled in the day-ahead market, then the ISO will necessarily collect enough congestion revenue through its day-ahead market to fully fund the FTRS.*

**FTR Underfunding:** If the ISO does not collect enough congestion revenue in the day-ahead market to satisfy the FTR entitlements, then FTR funding will be less than 100 percent. This situation indicates that the ISO issued more FTRs than the day-ahead network model could accommodate.

**Balancing Congestion:** If day-ahead schedules are infeasible in the real-time market, then congestion will occur in real time to "buy back" the day-ahead flows. The cost of doing so is uplifted to ISO customers as "balancing congestion".
