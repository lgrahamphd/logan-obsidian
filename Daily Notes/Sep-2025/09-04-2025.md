## 🎯 Key Outcomes
1. Congestion review and notes
2. Telluride development
3. Incremental progress on PROBE

## ⚡ Work Tasks
- [ ] Aug-2025 Top Congestion Review
- [x] Oct-2024 Top Congestion Review
- [ ] Download and install pyProbeSim
- [x] Telluride development
    - [x] Refactor `viz.py`
	- [x] Extract distribution plot template (violin/boxplot and style) so it can be reused elsewhere
	- [x] Directory and project reorganization
	- [x] Standardize imports
	    - [x] Do not use `from __future__ import annotations`, as it is unnecessary. Standardize all of the imports on the recently written files with the conventions elsewhere in `telluride`. For example, do not include imports like `from .util import rgba`. Rather, you should `import telluride.common.viz.util as vutil` then access `vutil.rgba` as needed. Don't import `List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`, `Set` from `typing`. Rather, use`list`, `tuple`, `dict`when doing type annotations.
	- [x] Add empirical cumulative distribution function plots to violins/boxplots. Plot the cdf to the right of the violin/boxplot. When multiple violins/boxplots are being compared as a group, then plot the cdfs in overlayed fashion to the right of the rightmost violin/boxplot.
- [ ] Data Center Alley congestion review  
    - [ ] Add distribution plots for aggregate shadow price grouped into Peak, Off-Peak, Weekend-On-Peak, Daily-Off-Peak  
        - [ ] Double check constraint universe -- are there extra constraints included that are outside of Data Center Alley?  
        - [ ] Add 2023 constraints to universe 
        - [ ] Add 2023 data to every plot except the difference time series
