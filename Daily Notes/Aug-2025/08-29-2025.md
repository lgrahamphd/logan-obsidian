## 🤔 Personal Reflection
The current fund performance is highly concerning. I need to look out for myself. I still think that my investment was a good decision, and the fund will recover the losses. That said, I've learned a lesson about how process and due diligence outweigh historical performance. Think like Alan Skrainka.
