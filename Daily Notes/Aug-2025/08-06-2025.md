## 📝 Notes
I discovered an issue with an incorrect line rating near Clinton. The branch overrides file that our code wrote has the wrong rating. The offending line is `348846 7CLINTON      345  348850 7LEGHORN      345  2`. In `override_branches_test.csv`, this has from_bus 348846, to_bus 348850, and circuit 2.
