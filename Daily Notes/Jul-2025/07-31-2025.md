## üìù Notes
- We lost money on 8/1/2025 on some expensive paths that had small, positive revenue and high cost.

---
## üìà Trading Philosophy
- Policy optimization is more important than forecast accuracy improvements, given good forecasts. Our objective is as follows:
    1. Achieve good forecasts from a variety of models with a great understanding of the model errors and error skew.
	2. Craft a risk-cognizant trading policy targeting skew and convexity.
- Remember to keep costs low.
- We want cheap, long exposure. We'd rather have a safe, cheap path that has the directional exposure that we want instead of an expensive path that has more exposure and more risk of binding event failure.
