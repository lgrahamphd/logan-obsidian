Invenergy Transmission is proposing to construct Grain Belt Express in two phases.   

Phase 1 extends between the line’s Kansas and Missouri interconnection points. Construction on Phase 1 is anticipated to begin in 2026.

Phase 2 extends between the line’s mid-point Missouri converter station and Indiana interconnection point. A schedule for Phase 2 has not yet been announced but will follow Phase 1. Grain Belt Express remains fully committed to both project phases.
