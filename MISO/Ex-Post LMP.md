The *ex post [[Locational Marginal Price]]* is an LMP computed through *Extended LMP (ELMP)*. ELMP is an enhanced pricing mechanism expanding upon LMP and MCP in which Fast Start Resources (FSR) may be included in the calculation of prices at the CPNodes located throughout the Transmission Provider Region. Specifically, the FSRs that may be included are those that are scheduled to operate at limits, certain off-line FSR, and the start-up or shut-down and no-load or curtailment costs of these FSR resources,

ELMP also provides the mechanism to introduce emergency pricing, in ex-post manner, to prevent inefficient price depression during system or local area shortage conditions when MISO utilizes Emergency Resources, including Emergency range of available resources, Emergency Demand Response Resources, Load Modifying Resources, External Resources that are qualified as Planning Resources, or Emergency Energy Purchases.

While the [[Ex-Ante LMP]] respects the physical and operational limitations of generation and transmission facilities, the Ex-Post LMP does not necessarily do so for Fast Start Resources.

### FTR Settlement
[[MISO]] FTRs settle against Ex-Post DA LMPs.
