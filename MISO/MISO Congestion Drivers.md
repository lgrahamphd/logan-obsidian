### Value of Real-Time Congestion
Define the *value of real-time congestion* as the product of physical flow over each constraint and that constraint's shadow price. This is the value of congestion that occurs as MISO dispatches its system.

### Wind Curtailment
Curtailment is when electricity generation is deliberately reduced below its maximum generation potential. Curtailments occur either when generation exceeds electricity demand (i.e., oversupply), or when insufficient transfer capacity is available to transmit electricity over its preferred path to meet demand (i.e., congestion).

Wind is curtailed before other resources in the Midwest because:
1. It is cheaper and faster to both shut down and restart wind (and solar) units than it is to do so for other types of generation.
2. On very windy days in particular locations, transmission capacity is often insufficient to accommodate the flows associated with the large amount of wind power generated.

See the EIA's 6/26/2024 article, [[Why are Midwest grid operators turning away wind power? - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62406)].

### Historical Drivers
In 2021-2022, Midwestern congestion dominated Southern congestion, excluding February, 2021 (winter storm Uri). High wind output caused almost half (44%) of MISO's transmission system congestion in 2022 (up from 36% in 2021), resulting in average hourly wind curtailments of 726 MW per hour, including curtailments of as much as 5.9 GW in some hours of 2022.
