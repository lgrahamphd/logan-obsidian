### Drivers
**Topology:**
Cooper NPPD - S3458 345 kV (i.e., Cooper - Nebraska City) was out of service 2024-09-24 09:28 - 2024-12-17 14:29. The only times this constraint (or any of its siblings) has ever bound in RT were 12/2/2024 and 12/12/2024.

**Generation:**
Cooper (801 MW, nuclear)

**Line Ratings:**
Static post-contingent rating of 295 MW.

**Flow Bias:**
From Cooper to Substation 1280 the vast majority of the time, aside from some shoulder season reversals occurring when Cooper is undergoing maintenance.

**Commentary:**
Barring an impactful forced outage, we don't envision this binding in FH25.
