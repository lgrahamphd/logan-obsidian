### Drivers
**Topology:**
- LISBOENDER11_1 1
- TRAVPFAIRM11_1 1
- GRANIBLAIR23_1 1
- Wishek TR12

**Generation:**
Wind generation in Southern North Dakota (Southeast of Bismarck, ND) and along the South Dakota-Minnesota border (North of Brookings, SD) as well as nearby fossil-fired plants push on the constraint.

**Line Ratings:**
Derated from 526 MW to 462 MW on 2024-12-04. Derated again from 462 MW to 450 MW on 2024-12-04. Uprated from 450 MW to 526 MW on 2024-12-05.

**Commentary:**
Requires high wind, a favorable outage, and often a derate to bind.

This constraint seems to require high wind generation mixed with favorable outages. For the 12/4-12/5 binding event, wind generation was above 22 GW MISO-wide (topping out at just over 24 GW). This, mixed with only slightly bullish outages -- Center - Jamestown 345 kV, Chapelle - Leland Olds 345 kV, Buffalo - Casselton 115 kV) were sufficient for binding. In its history, 22+ GW of wind is unnecessary for this constraint to bind. What appears to be necessary is a scenario in which wind generation and outages -- taken together -- are bullish enough to warrant binding.

### Forward View
Merricourt - Wishek 230 kV (1/6-3/14) Should wind material during this interval while the Twin Cities pull load, then there is risk that this constraint binds.
