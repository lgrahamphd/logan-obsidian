### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Line Ratings:**
Static at 287 MW (both ratings A and B)

**Flow Bias:** since the start of 2024, flow bias as continued to trend towards a stronger Southward bias. Before October, 2024, the flow bias was in favor of Northward flows.

**Transmission Outages:**

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Gibson (3.3 GW, bituminous coal ST, supercritical)

**High-Side Generation:**
- A. B. Brown (176 MW, NG CT)
- F. B. Culley (368 MW, bituminous coal ST). Unit 1 retired in 2006. Unit 2 (103 MW) to retire 12/2025. Unit 3 (265 MW) to convert from coal to gas in 2027.
- Warrick (822 MW, bituminous coal ST)

**Load:**
