#### Summary Characterization
Driven by bullish transmission outages and wind generation flowing into the Twin Cities. Typically needs high wind (>20 GW RTO-wide) and a bullish outage to bind. Chub Lake - Helena 345 kV outages are heavily bearish.
### Basic Facts
**Monitored Element:** CHUB_LK TR1_1
- Common Name: Chub Lake XF
- From Bus: GRE-CHUBLAK3
- To Bus: CHUB_LK
- From Zone: [[Northern States Power Company|NSP]]
- To Zone: [[Northern States Power Company|NSP]]
**For loss of:** NSP34055
1. HELENSCOTT34_1 1
    - From Bus: HELENA 3
    - To Bus: SCOTTCO3
**Direction Bound:** from the 345 kV level to the 1 kV level. This should be interpreted as binding down the transformer from the 345 kV level to the 115 kV level due to the star bus modeling technique.

### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Branch Ratings:** 448 MW (A and B ratings)

**Flow Bias:** from the 345 kV level to the 115 kV level (i.e., from the 1 kV level to the 115 kV level across the monitored element).

**Low-Side Generation:** Wind generation in Southwestern MN along the entire "wind generation L" (Odell, Trimont, Elm Creek, Red Pine, Blazing Star, etc.).

**High-Side Generation:**
- Faribault (334 MW, NG CC)
- Cottage Grove (283 MW, NG CC)
- Coal Creek (1.2 GW, lignite coal ST)
- Sherburne County (1.7 GW, subbituminous coal ST)
- Mankato Energy Center (740 MW, NG CC)

**Load:** Southern Minneapolis, Lakeville, Montgomery, Faribault, Le Center area on the 115 kV and 69 kV system.

### Binding Events and Drivers
**J25**
- High wind.
- Prairie Island - Red Rock 345 kV outage.
- North Rochester - Prairie Island 345 kV outage.
- High Bridge generation outage.
- Cannon Falls generation outage.
- Prairie Island generation outage.
**X24**
- Chub Lake - Hampton 345 kV outage.
- There were clear opportunities to make money with DECs at the beginning of this outage and with INCs after it ended.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
- Faribault out 10/10-10/19/2025, 4/10-4/30/26 (bullish).
- High Bridge out 9/12-9/25/2025, 3/13-3/26/2026 (bullish).
- Prairie Island - Red Rock 345 kV out 9/8/25-4/24/26 (bullish; *proposed*).
