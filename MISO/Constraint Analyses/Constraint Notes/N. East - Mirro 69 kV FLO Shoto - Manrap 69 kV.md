### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Branch Ratings:**
- Winter (Nov. 1 - Apr. 1) post-contingent rating: 95 MW.
- Spring (Apr. 1 - Jun. 1) post-contingent rating: 91 MW.
- Summer (Jun. 1 - Oct. 1) post-contingent rating: 86 MW.
- Fall (Oct. 1 - Nov. 1) post-contingent rating: 91 MW.

**Flow Bias:**
- From Mirro to N. East.
- Change point in constraint flow time series occurred around Jun. 1, 2023, at which flow averages nearly doubled. This exacerbated binding events in Summer-Fall 2023 and Summer-Fall 2024.

**Low-Side Generation:**

**High-Side Generation:**
Lakefront (currently on SSR status) is on the high side.

**Load:**

**Commentary:**
- Has essentially only ever bound in RT at summer ratings (86 MW, post-contingent) aside from a brief binding event in V23.
- The clear change point in the constraint flow time series and a before/after comparison with Panorama's impact tool indicate that something changed topologically at 12am on Jun. 1, 2023.
