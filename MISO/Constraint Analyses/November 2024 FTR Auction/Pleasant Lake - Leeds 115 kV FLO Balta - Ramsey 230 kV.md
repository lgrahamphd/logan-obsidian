### History
Bound 117.7 hours in RT from Sep. 15 - Oct. 15, 2024 at a $\$101.23/MWh$ average. This was the #1 RT constraint over this period.

### Drivers
**Topology:**
Branch rating decrease on 7/24/2024
- A and B summer ratings were originally 121 MW through 7/23/2024.
- A and B ratings both decreased to 61 MW from 7/24/2024-8/2/2024.
- A and B ratings both increased to 94 MW from 8/3/2024-10/1/2024 (the latest available SE case at the time of this writing).

Seasonal ratings changes started in 11/2020. From 2016-8/2020, A and B ratings were different. Thereafter, both ratings are the same. *Note that MISO's SE branch ratings are incorrect for this line, which is owned by SPP.*

Southward flows from Manitoba along PEACGRUGBY23_1 1 230 kV are upstream of the monitored element.

**Generation:**
- Rugby Wind Farm
- Coal Creek
- Border Winds Wind Farm

### Forward View
There is a high level of risk that this constraint will continue to bind as long as the derate persists. Branch flows on the monitored element have remained typical (slightly below average, in fact) during the period in which the constraint has bound.

Moreover, the constraint first bound immediately after the derate, and it's bound for a large portion of the hours thereafter.
