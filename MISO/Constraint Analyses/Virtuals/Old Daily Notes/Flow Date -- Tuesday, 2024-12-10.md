### Constraints
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV
Pelican Rapids - Tamarac 115 kV was out 2024-12-02 04:41 - 2024-12-02 22:41 and 2024-12-03 05:11 - 2024-12-05 20:11 on forced outages. This was heavily bearish the constraint. Now that this line has returned to service, the risk of this constraint binding has increased. FV $40/MWh during HE 16-22.
#### Wahpeton - Hankinson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. FV $20/MWh early in the day while wind generation is strong. DECs at OTP.OTPW_11.AZ and OTP.OTPW_8.AZ are attractive.
#### Buena Vista - Alta 69 kV FLO Little Sioux XF
Has been aggressively binding as of late. FV $50/MWh. Highest value during evening load ramp.
#### Hayward TR1 FLO Adams - Hayward 161 kV
Until 2024-12-20 11:00, this could be an attractive play via virtuals if one could secure cheap exposure via INCs at ALTW.BENT_TREE or DECs at ALTW.NSP or potentially ALTW.WELLS1 when load in Southern MN is forecast to be high. With warmer than normal temperatures, decrease the value. FV $5/MWh
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO Arrowhead TR6
Hilltop - 98L Tap4 230 kV in addition to its 230/115 kV transformer, Hilltop TR1, have been out since 2024-11-05 08:56, and it's planned to return 2024-12-19 17:00. This appears to be the leading topological driver. FV $8/MWh.
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Wind generation is forecast to be strong-moderate in the first half of the day. FV $5/MWh.
#### Maryville - Midway 161 kV FLO Fairport - Gentry - Nodaway 161 kV
Northboro - Orient 345 kV is out through 2024-12-23 15:00. FV $30/MWh.
