### Net Load
#### Weather
12/5 is predicted to be the coldest day over the 15-day forecast horizon. 47 WDDs in the West North Central region; 42 WDDs in the East North Central region.

At/colder than normals across the MISO footprint.

Des Moines, IA
- $9^\circ$ F / $21^\circ$ F
- Substantially colder than normals.
Other locations substantially colder than normals:
- Columbia, MO
- Decatur, IL
- Indianapolis, IN
- Kansas City, MO
- Peoria, IL
- Springfield, IL
#### Renewable Generation
MISO-wide wind generation is forecast to drop from 23.5 GW HE 1 to 6.8 GW HE 20, then up to 8.5 GW HE 24.
MISO-wide solar generation is forecast to top out at 5.7 GW HE 15.

### Generation Fleet
Prairie Island Unit 1 (551 MW) is due to return 12/5.

---
### Commentary
High load in IL, IA, MN, MO, WI, IN, ND will drive congestion. Fossil-fired generation will need to increasingly take the place of wind generation throughout the day. Net load will be evening-peaking with a 84 GW projected maximum HE 19-20.

### Constraints

#### Benton - Mud Lake 230 kV FLO Forbes - Chisago 500 kV
Strong Twin Cities load. Weakening wind generation. Coal-fired and gas-fired generation should ramp up, pushing on the constraint.
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Strong Twin Cities load. Wind generation is forecast to be strong-moderate in the first half of the day. We recommend targeting these hours.
#### Blackberry - Iron Range 230 kV FLO Forbes - Chisago 500 kV
Clay Boswell, Sherburne County expected to be in the money with high load in Eastern MN. These will push on the constraint.
#### Wilmarth - Swan Lake 115 kV FLO Helena - Sheas Lake 345 kV
Mankato Energy Center expected to be in the money for the evening ramp. This will push on the constraint.
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV or FLO Frontier - Wahpeton 230 kV
The Sheyenne - Lake Park 230 kV outage is still in place. With such strong demand in the region, we see risk that this binds. Hoot Lake Solar should also push on the constraint.
