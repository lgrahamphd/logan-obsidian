### Net Load
#### Weather
30 WDDs in MISO classic, warmer than normal. BIsmarck, ND ($14^\circ$/$22^\circ$F), Fargo, ND ($14^\circ$/$23^\circ$ F), and Winnipeg, MB ($6^\circ$/$16^\circ$ F) are the only three load pockets at normal temperatures. All other load pockets are warmer or substantially warmer than normal.
#### Load Pockets with Largest Deviations from Normal Temperatures
Much of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi are exceptionally warmer than normal.
#### Load
Evening-peaking, bimodal load shape with a shallow midday valley. 79 GW during the morning ramp, 82 GW during the evening ramp.
#### Renewable Generation
19 GW of wind generation HE 1, falling off to 5 GW by HE 9, then reaching a daily minimum of 4 GW HE 13. Gradual ramping around the time of the evening load peak, finishing HE 24 between 7-8 GW.
Solar generation reaching 3.7 GW.
#### Net Load Outlook
Evening-peaking, bimodal net-load shape. 74 GW HE 9, 76 GW HE 19.

### Other Notes
Coal-fired generation has remained "sticky" -- as net load fell off during the weekend, gas share of thermal has decreased.

### Constraints
#### Forman (OTP) - Forman (WAUE) 115 kV FLO Wahpeton
Strong wind generation early in the day. FV $7/MWh.
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO Arrowhead TR6
Hilltop - 98L Tap4 230 kV in addition to its 230/115 kV transformer, Hilltop TR1, have been out since 2024-11-05 08:56, and it's planned to return 2024-12-19 17:00. This appears to be the leading topological driver. FV $3/MWh.
#### Wall Lake - Blairsburg 69 kV FLO Wall Lake - Franklin 161 kV
Target the morning load ramp as we expect Century Wind Farm to have high output. This has sent ALTW.HCPD.STHP high and MEC.CENTURY_1. FV $5/MWh.
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Minneapolis-Saint Paul will be pulling power from Western wind generation. FV $5/MWh.
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV
Pelican Rapids - Tamarac 115 kV was out 2024-12-02 04:41 - 2024-12-02 22:41 and 2024-12-03 05:11 - 2024-12-05 20:11 on forced outages. This was heavily bearish the constraint. Now that this line has returned to service, the risk of this constraint binding has increased. FV $7/MWh.
#### Wahpeton - Hankinson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. FV $5/MWh. DECs at OTP.OTPW_11.AZ and OTP.OTPW_8.AZ are attractive.
#### Hayward TR1 FLO Adams - Hayward 161 kV
Until 2024-12-20 11:00, this could be an attractive play via virtuals if one could secure cheap exposure via INCs at ALTW.BENT_TREE or DECs at ALTW.NSP or potentially ALTW.WELLS1. FV $6/MWh.
#### Maryville - Midway 161 kV FLO Fairport - Gentry - Nodaway 161 kV
Northboro - Orient 345 kV is out through 2024-12-23 15:00. FV $7/MWh.
#### Benton - Mud Lake 230 kV FLO Forbes - Chisago 500 kV
Strong flows to Northern MN from Sherburne County, Monticello, Sherco Solar, Elk River. Bound during morning ramp on 2024-12-12. FV $7/MWh.
#### Quad Cities - Rock Creek 345 kV FLO Quad Cities - Substation 91
One of the top performing constraints as of late as supply makes its way Westward from the nukes in the greater Chicago region. FV $5/MWh.
