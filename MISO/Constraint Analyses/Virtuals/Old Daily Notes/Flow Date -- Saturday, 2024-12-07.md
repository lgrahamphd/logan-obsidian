### Net Load
#### Weather
27 HDDs in West North Central, down from 38 on Friday. This is still warmer than normal.
31 HDDs in East North Central, down from 41 on Friday. This is normal.
##### Load Pockets with Largest Deviations from Normal
- Bismarck, ND: *exceptionally warmer than normal*; $29^\circ$ F low, $46^\circ$ F high
- Winnipeg, MB: *exceptionally warmer than normal*; $24^\circ$ low, $39^\circ$ F high
- Broadly, much warmer than normal in the MISO North population centers and in St. Joseph, MO.
- Much colder than normal in several MISO South locations in TX, LA, MS.
#### Load
Morning peaking bimodal load shape. 81 GW HE 9-10. 79 GW HE 19.
#### Renewable Generation
Wind generation to ramp gradually throughout the day from 14 GW HE 1 to 23 GW HE 19 before dropping off Sunday morning.
Solar generation to reach 5 GW, remaining steady throughout the day.
#### Net Load Outlook
Morning peaking net load. 60 GW HE 9. 56 GW net load HE 19 during the evening peak.

### Other Notes
Prairie Island Unit 1 was supposed to return to service yesterday, 12/5, yet it reported to NRC at a 0% capacity factor both on 12/5 and on 12/6. Unclear when it will return.

----
### Forward View
Target high wind generation HE 16-22 mixed with weak load. Wind generation curtailment seems likely. INCs could be a good play.

### Constraints
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV
Pelican Rapids - Tamarac 115 kV was out 2024-12-02 04:41 - 2024-12-02 22:41 and 2024-12-03 05:11 - 2024-12-05 20:11 on forced outages. This was heavily bearish the constraint. Now that this line has returned to service, the risk of this constraint binding has increased. FV $40/MWh during HE 16-22.
#### Wahpeton - Hankinson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. FV $30/MWh during HE 16-22.
#### Buena Vista - Alta 69 kV FLO Little Sioux XF
Has been aggressively binding as of late. FV $50-100/MWh throughout the day. Highest value HE 16-22.
#### Hayward TR1 FLO Adams - Hayward 161 kV
Until 2024-12-20 11:00, this could be an attractive play via virtuals if one could secure cheap exposure via INCs at ALTW.BENT_TREE or DECs at ALTW.NSP or potentially ALTW.WELLS1 when load in Southern MN is forecast to be high. With warmer than normal temperatures, decrease the value. FV $5/MWh
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO Arrowhead TR6
Hilltop - 98L Tap4 230 kV in addition to its 230/115 kV transformer, Hilltop TR1, have been out since 2024-11-05 08:56, and it's planned to return 2024-12-19 17:00. This appears to be the leading topological driver. FV $8/MWh.
