Flow Date: 2024-12-11
### Net Load
#### Weather
A cold front from Manitoba and Saskatchewan moves into North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota on the evening of 12/10 and into the morning of 12/11.

45 WDDs in the West North Central (colder than normal).
40 WDDs in the East North Central (colder than normal).
#### Load Pockets with Largest Deviations from Normal
- Bismarck, ND: $-3^\circ$ F low, $7^\circ$ F high; *exceptionally colder than normal*
- Fargo, ND: $-10^\circ$ F low, $9^\circ$ F high; *exceptionally colder than normal*
- Winnipeg, MB: $-16^\circ$ F low, $-4^\circ$ F high; *exceptionally colder than normal*
The majority of the MISO footprint is colder than normal.
#### Load
Bimodal, evening peaking load shape. 87 GW HE 9. 90 GW HE 19.
#### Renewable Generation
Wind generation ramping up from 12 GW HE 1 to 21 GW HE 16, then back down to 13 GW by HE 24.
Solar generation reaching 4.5 GW with some risk of jumping above 5 GW HE 15.
#### Net Load Outlook
Bimodal, evening, peaking net load shape. 68 GW HE 9. 73 GW HE 21.

### Other Notes
Monticello reported to the NRC at a 45% capacity factor on the morning of 12/10. Prairie Island Unit 1 is also out. That's a total of 900 MW (assuming the 45% capacity factor persists) - 1.278 GW (assuming a 0% capacity factor for Monticello) of generation capacity that will need to be filled as the cold front rolls in.

### Constraints
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Minneapolis-Saint Paul will be pulling power from Western wind generation as the cold front spikes demand and the two nukes are out. FV $15/MWh.
#### Swan Lake - Wilmarth 115 kV FLO Helena - Sheas Lake 345 kV
With the high load scenario and Minneapolis-St. Paul missing the nukes, Mankato Energy Center is likely in the money, which will push on the constraint. FV $10/MWh.
#### Buena Vista - Alta 69 kV FLO Little Sioux XF
Has been aggressively binding as of late. FV $40/MWh. Highest value during evening load ramp.
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV
Pelican Rapids - Tamarac 115 kV was out 2024-12-02 04:41 - 2024-12-02 22:41 and 2024-12-03 05:11 - 2024-12-05 20:11 on forced outages. This was heavily bearish the constraint. Now that this line has returned to service, the risk of this constraint binding has increased. FV $10/MWh.
#### Wahpeton - Hankinson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. FV $10/MWh. DECs at OTP.OTPW_11.AZ and OTP.OTPW_8.AZ are attractive.
#### Hayward TR1 FLO Adams - Hayward 161 kV
Until 2024-12-20 11:00, this could be an attractive play via virtuals if one could secure cheap exposure via INCs at ALTW.BENT_TREE or DECs at ALTW.NSP or potentially ALTW.WELLS1 when load in Southern MN is forecast to be high. With warmer than normal temperatures, decrease the value. FV $5/MWh. Has not bound in RT since 12/4, but it has bound (at muted shadow prices) in the DAM.
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO Arrowhead TR6
Hilltop - 98L Tap4 230 kV in addition to its 230/115 kV transformer, Hilltop TR1, have been out since 2024-11-05 08:56, and it's planned to return 2024-12-19 17:00. This appears to be the leading topological driver. FV $5/MWh.
#### Maryville - Midway 161 kV FLO Fairport - Gentry - Nodaway 161 kV
Northboro - Orient 345 kV is out through 2024-12-23 15:00. FV $15/MWh.
#### Forman (OTP) - Forman (WAUE) 115 kV FLO Wahpeton
Strong wind generation. High load environment in the region. FV $10/MWh.
