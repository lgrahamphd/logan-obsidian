### Net Load
#### Weather
Winter, colder than normal temperatures in MISO North on 12/4. 12/5 is forecast to be significantly below normal temperatures both in the West North Central and East North Central regions. The cold is to persist into 12/6 more so in the East North Central region.
#### Renewable Generation
High wind generation, 23 GW RTO-wide. MISO-forecasts appear too high (not accounting for enough curtailment), as they are above Meteologica's 90th percentile and portend new records.

3 GW of solar generation, which is relatively weak.

---
### Other Notes
Prairie Island (nuke, 2 units, 1.186 GW) has one unit out through 12/5. This leaves the Twin Cities' stack thin, exacerbating the pull on wind generation.
West of New Orleans, Waterford Unit 3 (nuke, 1.2 GW) tripped during HE 13 on Tuesday, 12/2.

### Commentary
We see substantial risk of wind-driven congestion in MISO North.

### Constraints
#### Cooper - Substation 1280 161 kV FLO Moore - Cooper 345 kV
Atchison - Northboro 345 kV and Northboro - Orient 345 kV are out. Atchison - Northboro 345 kV is a planned outage to return 2024-12-04 12:00, and Northboro - Orient 345 kV is unplanned. With these lines out, Farmers City wind farm (146 MW) is radial. In light of the high wind generation forecast for 12/4, we see a 70% chance that this binds, particularly after wind generation at the MEC.FARMER pnode ramps at/after HE 5.
#### Maryville - Midway 161 kV FLO Fairport - Gentry - Nodaway 161 kV
See above comments regarding Cooper - Substation 1280 161 kV FLO Moore - Cooper 345 kV's drivers.
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
High wind, strong Twin Cities load.
#### Pleasant Valley - Byron 161 kV FLO Byron - Pleasant Valley 345 kV
Adams - Pleasant Valley 345 kV, Adams - Mitchell County 345 kV outages planned for 2024-12-04 09:00 - 17:00.
#### Magic City - Souris 115 kV FLO Leland Olds - Logan 230 kV
High wind generation in ND. See New Frontier wind farm. Particularly HE 1- HE 16.
