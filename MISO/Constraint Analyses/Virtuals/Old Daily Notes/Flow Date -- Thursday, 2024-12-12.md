### Other Notes
Prairie Island Unit 1 remains out. Monticello reported at a 32% capacity factor this morning.
DARTs were heavily negative on Tuesday, 12/10. -$15.10/MWh daily average DART at Indy Hub. This was due to system lambda (1 GW load under-prediction) and RDT binding from South to North.

### Constraints
#### Buena Vista - Alta 69 kV FLO Little Sioux XF
Has been aggressively binding as of late. FV $40/MWh. This will persist as long as the 69 kV outages continue to slip.
#### Wall Lake - Blairsburg 69 kV FLO Wall Lake - Franklin 161 kV
Target the morning load ramp as we expect Century Wind Farm to have high output. This has sent ALTW.HCPD.STHP high and MEC.CENTURY_1. FV $5/MWh.
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Minneapolis-Saint Paul will be pulling power from Western wind generation as the cold front spikes demand and the two nukes are out. FV $10/MWh.
#### Swan Lake - Wilmarth 115 kV FLO Helena - Sheas Lake 345 kV
With the high load scenario and Minneapolis-St. Paul missing the nukes, Mankato Energy Center is likely in the money, which will push on the constraint. FV $7/MWh.
#### Edge Tap - Pelican Rapids 115 kV FLO Silver Lake - Fergus Falls 230 kV
Pelican Rapids - Tamarac 115 kV was out 2024-12-02 04:41 - 2024-12-02 22:41 and 2024-12-03 05:11 - 2024-12-05 20:11 on forced outages. This was heavily bearish the constraint. Now that this line has returned to service, the risk of this constraint binding has increased. FV $7/MWh.
#### Wahpeton - Hankinson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. FV $7/MWh. DECs at OTP.OTPW_11.AZ and OTP.OTPW_8.AZ are attractive.
#### Hayward TR1 FLO Adams - Hayward 161 kV
Until 2024-12-20 11:00, this could be an attractive play via virtuals if one could secure cheap exposure via INCs at ALTW.BENT_TREE or DECs at ALTW.NSP or potentially ALTW.WELLS1 when load in Southern MN is forecast to be high. FV $7/MWh.
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO Arrowhead TR6
Hilltop - 98L Tap4 230 kV in addition to its 230/115 kV transformer, Hilltop TR1, have been out since 2024-11-05 08:56, and it's planned to return 2024-12-19 17:00. This appears to be the leading topological driver. FV $3/MWh.
#### Maryville - Midway 161 kV FLO Fairport - Gentry - Nodaway 161 kV
Northboro - Orient 345 kV is out through 2024-12-23 15:00. FV $10/MWh.
#### Forman (OTP) - Forman (WAUE) 115 kV FLO Wahpeton
Strong wind generation. High load environment in the region. FV $7/MWh.

California - Apache Flats 161 FLO Burns - Montgomery 161 kV in AMMO has been ripping. What's going on here? AECI effects?
