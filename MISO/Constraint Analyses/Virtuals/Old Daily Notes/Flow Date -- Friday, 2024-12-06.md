### Net Load
#### Weather
37 HDDs in West North Central, down from 47 on Thursday. This is still slightly colder than normal.
40 HDDs in East North Central, down from 42 on Thursday. This is a moderately colder than normal.
##### Load Pockets with Largest Deviations from Normal
- Indianapolis, IN: *much colder than normal*; $12^\circ$ F low, $30^\circ$ F high
- Evansville, IN: *much colder than normal*; $15^\circ$ F low, $34^\circ$ F high
- Bismarck, ND: *slightly warmer than normal*; $16^\circ$ F low, $38^\circ$ F high
- Winnipeg, MB: *slightly warmer than normal*; $14^\circ$ low, $24^\circ$ F high
#### Load
Morning peaking bimodal load shape. 93 GW HE 9. 88 GW HE 19.
#### Renewable Generation
Wind generation to ramp up gradually from 9.5 GW HE 0 to 15.5 GW HE 8-9 then gradually down to 10.5 GW by the time of the evening peak.
Solar generation to reach 5.5 GW, remaining steady throughout the day.
#### Net Load Outlook
Morning and evening peaks are forecast to have relatively the same net load. While the morning load shape is morning-peaking, the drop off in wind generation throughout the day leads to competitive net loads at the time of the evening peak. We see some risk for costly generation ramp-ups if wind underperforms in the morning. In MISO Central, it will be worth watching the solar generation drop off as well.

### Other Notes
Prairie Island Unit 1 (551 MW) is due to return 12/5, but it did not report a capacity factor indicative of this the morning of 12/5.

### Constraints
#### Helena - Scott County 345 kV FLO Chubb Lake - Helena 345 kV
Strong Twin Cities load. Wind generation is forecast to be strong-moderate in the first half of the day. We recommend targeting these hours. FV $5/MWh.
#### Wahpeton - Hankson 230 kV FLO Mandan - Napoleon 230 kV, FLO Brookings County - Astoria 345 kV
Wind generation at Merricourt, Tatanka Wind Power, Foxtail. We expect this to persist as it remains cold in Northern MN. FV $50/MWh.
#### Arrowhead TR7 FLO  Arrowhead TR6
We expect this to persist. Imports into Forbes and Chisago County from Winnipeg fit with the weather forecast. Boswell and Monticello push. FV $9/MWh.

### Commentary
I like DECs at OTP.OTP_11.AZ and OTP.OTP_8.AZ, driven by Wahpeton - Hankson. Symmetrically, I like INCs at MDU.MERRICOURT, MDU.FOXTL.WND, and MDU.TATANKA1.

The Alden - Walters and the Hayward transformer constraints are intriguing as well. I plan to dig into these today.
