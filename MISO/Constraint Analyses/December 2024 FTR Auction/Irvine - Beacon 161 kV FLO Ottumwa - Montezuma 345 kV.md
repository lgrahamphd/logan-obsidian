### History
Bound $51.5$ hours in RT from Oct. 1 - Nov. 11, 2024 at a $\$2.67/MWh$ average. $43.8$ of these binding hours were Off-Peak. The period average for Off-Peak was $\$4.42/MWh$.

### Drivers
**Topology:**
The Reasnor - Poweshiek - Irvine 161 kV outage from 2024-9-20 08:18 - 2024-10-18 11:25 was substantially bearish for the present constraint, and it did not bind while this outage was in place. After this 161 kV path returned to service, the present constraint began to bind in RT again.

**Generation:**

**Load:**

**Line Ratings:**
Historic data indicate a seasonal uprate on Nov. 1 from 310 MW to 361 MW. State estimator data indicate that there have been dynamic line ratings in place since the winter of 2022-2023, which can lead to line ratings that flex up to 396 MW. Despite this, the present constraint has bound in November month-to-date.

**Commentary:**

### Forward View
There remains risk that the present constraint will bind in December despite the line uprates.

Should the present constraint bind, it would benefit a short position on the ALTW.GRCT.ARR -> MEC.CMMPA.MONT path, since it would depress MEC.CMMPA.MONT.
