### Transmission Outages
Three in-series 345 kV line outages in Michigan:
- Monroe - Wayne: out from 10/1/2024 - 11/28/2024
- Majestic - Wayne: out from 9/9/2024 - 1/31/2025
- Coventry - Majestic: out from 10/18/2024 - 11/1/2024

In PJM, Marysville - Flatlick 765 kV is out from 10/10/2024 - 11/14/2024. This cuts off Northward supply into Columbus, OH.

The in-series 345 kV lines Dumont - Elderberry and Sorenson - Dumont are both out from 10/7/2024 - 1/15/2025. This has contributed to the (PJM) East Lima - Haviland 138 kV constraint binding today, 10/30, as flows try to make their way Eastward from the IN/OH border into the cluster of AD Hub nodes in Lima, OH and eventually onto Columbus, OH. Moreover, with these two lines out, output from St. Joseph Energy Center (780 MW NG CC) is essentially cut off from the Fort Wayne, IN load pocket.

### Seasonal Line Ratings
Lallendorf - Monroe 345 kV and Morocco - Lulu 345 kV comprise the Southward takeaway capacity from Monroe and Fermi into ATSI. Historically, the lines' ratings increase at 00:00 on 11/1 from 2.124 GW to 2.273 GW (Morocco - Lulu) and from 1.66 GW to 1.74 GW (Lallendorf - Monroe).

Despite these line ratings increases, the aforementioned Michigan transmission outages along with high Michigan wind generation suggest that there is risk of constraints defined on these two 345 kV seam lines binding 10/31/2024-11/1/2024.

### Generation
In MISO, Monroe (3.3 GW coal-fired plant) and Fermi (1.2 GW nuclear-fired plant) could push on Lallendorf - Monroe 345 kV and Morocco - Lulu 345 kV constraints.

Michigan wind generation is forecast to reach 2.35 GW at 05:50 EPT on Friday, 11/1.

In ATSI, Fremont Energy Center (740 MW NG CC) is out from 10/14/2024 - 11/06/2024.

### PJM Constraints
East Lima - Haviland 138 kV FLO East Lima - Maddox Creek 345 kV is splitting AD Hub in two. This constraint is heavily wind-driven, so I expect significant risk of it binding 10/31/2024 - 11/1/2024 (inclusive). It sends Southwestern MI, Northern IN, and Eastern IN negative and the greater Lima, OH area high. Some of Cook's 2.3 GW output also pushes on this constraint.
