### Drivers
**Topology:**

**Generation:**
Wind generation in Southern North Dakota (Southeast of Bismarck, ND) and along the South Dakota-Minnesota border (North of Brookings, SD) as well as nearby fossil-fired plants push on the constraint.
- [[Emmons-Logan Wind Farm]]
- [[Merricourt Wind Project]]
- [[Foxtail Wind Farm]]
- [[Tatanka Wind Power]]
- [[Dakota Range Wind Project]]
- [[Crowned Ridge Wind Project]]
- [[Crocker Wind]]
- Deuel Harvest Wind Energy
- [[Tatanka Ridge Wind Farm]]
- Buffalo Ridge Wind Project
- [[Blazing Star Wind Farm]]
- Deer Creek Station
- [[Big Stone]]
- Astoria Station

**Load:**
Wahpeton, ND; Fargo, ND; Fergus Falls, MN; North-Central, MN.

**Line Ratings:**
Static post-contingent line rating at 526 MW.

**Commentary:**
This constraint seems to require high wind generation mixed with favorable outages. For the 12/4-12/5 binding event, wind generation was above 22 GW MISO-wide (topping out at just over 24 GW). This, mixed with only slightly bullish outages -- Center - Jamestown 345 kV, Chapelle - Leland Olds 345 kV, Buffalo - Casselton 115 kV) were sufficient for binding. In its history, 22+ GW of wind is unnecessary for this constraint to bind. What appears to be necessary is a scenario in which wind generation and outages -- taken together -- are bullish enough to warrant binding.

### Forward View
John Junction - Ortonville 115 kV and John Junction - Graceville 115 kV are scheduled to be out simultaneously 2024-12-16 09:30 - 2024-12-20 15:29. This suggests some opportunities with DECs at OTP.OTPW_11.AZ.

Several January planned outages are moderately bullish the constraint. These include Quarry - Monticello 345 kV (1/22, 1/23), Merricourt - Wishek 230 kV (1/6-3/14), TR61 at Riel in MHEB (1/12-1/18), and Bison - Alexandria 345 kV (1/6-1/31). Should wind material during this interval while the Twin Cities pull load, then there is risk that this constraint binds.
