### Drivers
**Topology:**
Backbone 345 kV transmission in the region supports West-to-East and South-to-North flows from wind generation to the Minneapolis-St. Paul load pocket. The following transmission outages were in place during the September, 2024 period when the constraint bound frequently in RT:
- Steep Bank Lake - Hawk Nest Lake 345 kV
- Steep Bank Lake - Lyon County 345 kV
- Hawk Nest Lake - Lyon County 345 kV
- Hazel Creek - Lyon County 345 kV
- Lyon County XF9 345/115/34.5 kV three-phase transformer.

With these outages in place, the two-branch path comprised of Sheas Lake - Wilmarth and Helena - Sheas Lake (the present constraint's contingency) is critical to flow capacity from wind generation to the Southwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In light of these outages, should Helena - Sheas Lake (or Sheas Lake - Wilmarth) be lost, the flows into the Wilmarth substation from 345 kV lines Crandal - Wilmarth and Wilmarth - Huntley would be terminal at the 345 kV voltage level. Such flows would step down to the 115 kV level, particularly along the monitored element, as it is the only 115 kV line incident to Wilmarth that can supply the New Ulm, MN area.

**Generation:**
Wind generation in Southern MN and Northern IA push on the monitored element. Such wind farms include Palo Alto (Northern IA, 340 MW), Upland Prairie (Northern IA, 299 MW), and Trimont Area (Southern MN, 101 MW).

**Load:**
Minneapolis-St. Paul and towns to the West of the Twin Cities.
