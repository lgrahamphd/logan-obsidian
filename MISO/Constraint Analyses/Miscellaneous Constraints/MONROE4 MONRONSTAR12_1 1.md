### Basic Facts
* Monitored Element: MONRONSTAR12_1 1
	* 120 kV line
- [[MISO]]
	- DECO, DECO
- For loss of MOROCCO-MONROE-MILAN 345
	- Set of three 345 kV lines
- Direction: forward
- Constraint ID: 280856
- June, 2024 History
	- Bound 36% of Peak hours
	- Bound 10% of Off-peak hours
### Drivers
- Takeaway capacity from Monroe
	- Coal
	- 3.3 GW
	- DECO
	- 823 MW returned from outage on 6/16/2024
- Transshipment; supply from:
	- Fermi
		- Nuclear
		- 1.2 GW
		- DECO
		- Returned from outage on 5/23/2024
	- Belle River
		- Coal
		- 1.4 GW
		- DECO
	- Blue Water Energy Center
		- Gas (Combined Cycle)
		- 1.3 GW
	- Bruce
		- Nuclear
		- Ontario
	- Pickering
		- Nuclear
		- Ontario
- Highly sensitive to nuclear and coal-fired generation on the low side
	- Last bound 12/12/2023
- Does not appear to be the result of transmission outages
	- CARLTQUEEN1 shows a large LCDF in 10/2024, 12/2024, but this is merely a 41.6 kV line
### Forward View
Constraint to bind in July, as long as Monroe and Fermi run. Keep track of Monroe's dark spreads to determine if it will be in the money (high confidence that they will be and Monroe will run).
