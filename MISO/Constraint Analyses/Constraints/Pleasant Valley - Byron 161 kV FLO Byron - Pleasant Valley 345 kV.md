### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Branch Ratings:**
The post-contingent line rating remains at 557 MW throughout the year aside from brief derates down to 504 MW that have occurred in October 2023, June-July 2022, and at times is 2021.

**Flow Bias:**
Flow bias is Northward during the winter and Southward during the summer.

**Transmission Outages:**
- Rochester - Adams 115 kV

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Pleasant Valley Wind Farm (200 MW)
- Grand Meadow Wind Farm (100 MW)
- Pioneer Prairie Wind Farm (300 MW)
- Turtle Creek Wind Farm (200 MW)
In general, wind generation in Northern IA and Southern MN pushes on the constraint.

**High-Side Generation:**
- Faribault (334 MW, NG CC)
- Prairie Island (1.86 GW, nuclear)
- Sherburne County (1.7 GW, subbituminous coal ST)
Generation in the Twin Cities area.

**Load:**
- Large swaths of Minnesota, Western Wisconsin, and North Dakota are on the high side. Locally, Rochester, MN, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN, and Eau Claire, WI are on the high side.
