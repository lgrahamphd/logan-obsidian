### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Line Ratings:** dynamic ratings ranging form 112 MW to 145 MW (both ratings A and B are the same).

**Flow Bias:** bidirectional; roughly 65% of the time from Dumas to Reed.

**Transmission Outages:**

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Dam 2 (103 MW, Hydro)
- Stuttgart Solar (81 MW)
- Pine Bluff Energy Center & Mill (230 MW, NG CC; biomass ST)

**High-Side Generation:**
- Chicot Solar (100 MW)
- Prairie Mist Solar (109 MW)
- Crossett Solar (100 MW)
- Bayou Galion Solar Project (98 MW)
- Harvest Gold Solar (99 MW)
- Grand Gulf (1.4 GW, nuclear)
- Waterford 3 (1.2 GW, nuclear)
- Perryville (824 MW, NG CC)
- McAdams and Big Cajun relieve the constraint.
Gas-fired plants near Waterford including Taft Cogeneration.

**Load:**
- 115 kV level load in the greater Greenville, MS area (including AR, MS, LA).
- Excess load in Eastern LA drives the constraint to bind.

**Commentary:**
Solar generation on the high side can relieve ~50 MW of flow after netting out low side solar generation.
