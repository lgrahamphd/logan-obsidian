### Basic Facts
- Monitored Element: WITHYTWINI13_1 1
	- 138 kV line
- [[MISO]]
	- CONS, CONS
- For loss of LIVINGSTON 345/138 #2
	- 345/138 kV transformer
- Direction: forward
- Constraint ID: 453094
- June, 2024 History
	- Bound 6% of Peak hours
	- Bound 4% of Off-peak hours
### Drivers
There are two 345/138 kV Livingston transformers. There are only a few 345/138 kV transformers in North-Central (contiguous) Michigan. GALLAGHE TB2, KEYSTON3 TB1, and KEYSTON3 TB2 are other such 345/138 transformers. Should one or both of the 345/138 kV Livingston transformers be lost, then it will be difficult for any of the 345 kV supply to step down to the 138 kV level. CONS.ALCONA, CONS.HILMN.ARR, CONS.ALPENTHBA, CONS.VKLINCOLN, CONS.DR.WPSC will be short supply.
- LIVINGST TB1 (one of the two Livingston 345/138 kV transformers) was on outage 6/17/2024-6/20/2024
	- Led to subsequent DA binding
### Forward View
This constraint seems to be a result of losing the Livingston transformer. No planned outages for either Livingston transformer are in place. We don't see this constraint binding (FLO the same contingency) barring a forced outage to one of the two Livingston transformers.
