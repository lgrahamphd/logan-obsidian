**Transmission Outages:**
Pleasant Prairie - Zion Station 345 kV
- Clearly drove the July, 2023 binding event.
- Clearly drove the March, 2020 binding event.

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Paris Solar
- Elm Road
- South Oak Creek (to retire Dec. 2025)
- Point Beach
- Monticello

**High-Side Generation:**
- Comed-area nukes

**Load:**
- Zion, IL
- Waukegan, IL
- Chicago, IL

**Commentary:**
Clearly driven by the outage on the parallel 345 kV line, Pleasant Prairie - Zion Station.
