### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Branch Ratings:**
Static 112 MW post-contingent rating.

**Flow Bias:**
Exclusively down the transformer.

**Transmission Outages:**
Nov. 5, 2024 - Mar. 13, 2025
- Stark difference in constraint flows; did not bind during this interval.
- Settler's Trail Wind Farm, Benton Co. Wind Farm, and Pioneer Trail Wind Farm (which push on the constraint) all saw their GSFs vanish on 11/5/24. These shift factors returned to normal on 3/13/25. It's unclear what drove the clear topological change.
- 69 kV system around Wadena was islanded with the contingency and the outages.

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Benton County Wind Farm
- Settlers Trail Wind Farm
- Ford County Wind Farm
East-Central IL wind generation.

**High-Side Generation:**
- Hoosier Wind Farm

**Load:**
- Fowler, IN
- Goodland, IN

**Commentary:**
Chronic. Binds extremely frequently. Has bound even when the outage mix is bearish.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
Outside of the X24H25 period during which the 69 kV system around Wadena was islanded in the post-contingent setting, this constraint has bound like clockwork.
