### Drivers
**Topology:**
Backbone 345 kV transmission to the South of the monitored element provides key transmission capacity for West-to-East flows from wind generation to the Minneapolis-St. Paul load pocket. The following transmission outages were in place during the September, 2024 period when the constraint bound frequently in RT:
- Steep Bank Lake - Hawk Nest Lake 345 kV
- Steep Bank Lake - Lyon County 345 kV
- Hawk Nest Lake - Lyon County 345 kV
- Hazel Creek - Lyon County 345 kV
- Lyon County XF9 345/115/34.5 kV three-phase transformer.

With these outages in place, the monitored Watertown - Appledorn - Granite Falls 230 kV path and the Watertown - Blair - Granite Falls 230 kV path are critical for the aforementioned West-to-East flows. Should Appledorn - Watertown be lost, Watertown - Blair - Granite Falls path would receive increased flows.

**Generation:**
- [[Blazing Star Wind Farm]]
- [[Crocker Wind]]
- [[Antelope Valley]]
- [[Foxtail Wind Farm]]
- [[Sweetland Wind Farm]]
- [[Merricourt Wind Project]]
- [[Big Stone]]
- [[Tatanka Ridge Wind Farm]]

**Load:**
Minneapolis-St. Paul load pocket.
