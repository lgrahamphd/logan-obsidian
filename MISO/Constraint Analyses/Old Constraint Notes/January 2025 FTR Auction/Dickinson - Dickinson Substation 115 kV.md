### Drivers
**Topology:**
Coon Creek - Dickupa 345 kV is due to be out 2025-01-27 10:00 - 2025-01-29 16:00. Panorama estimates a +112% impact on the monitored element's flows as a percentage of its line rating.
Monticello T10 345/1 kV is due to be out 2025-01-13 09:00 - 2025-01-13 17:00, which is also heavily bullish the constraint.
Last, Sherburne County TR 9-1 and TR 9-2 are due to be out 2025-01-06 09:00 - 2025-01-24 17:00. These are moderately bullish the constraint.

**Generation:**
Wind generation in the Western portion of MISO North.

**Load:**
Northern suburbs of the Twin Cities.

**Line Ratings:**
Post-contingent line rating uprates from 174.2 MW to 238.2 MW Dec. 1-2.

### Forward View
It's worth assigning some positive value to this constraint given the outage impacts, even though they're relatively brief. During the outages, this constraint could bind at a high shadow price and influence prices throughout the region.

### Highest Exposure Paths
We don't recommend targeting this constraint specifically, but it is important to assign some value to it given its potential strong, but brief impact in driving West-to-East congestion over a roughly 3 days in late January, 2025.
