### Drivers
**Topology:**

**Generation:**
- Wind generation that flows onto the [[Brookings Second Circuit]]
- Wind generation around [[Lakefield Junction Station]]
- [[Mankato Energy Center]]
- [[Lakefield Junction Station]]

**Load:**
- Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN
- Majority of Wisconsin (excluding Milwaukee)

**Line Ratings:**
SE data show static line ratings at 1.793 GW.

**Commentary:**
As one would expect with a 345 kV monitored element, trading this constraint is more of a macro-play. It's heavily influenced by generation.

### Forward View
 In Z24, F25, if it's cold in the Twin Cities and Wisconsin and windy in the West, then expect Helena - Scott County to bind.
