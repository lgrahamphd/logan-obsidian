### Drivers
**Topology:**
Clarinda - Hastings 161 kV has been out since 2024-11-1, and its outage is planned to end on 2024-12-15.

Northboro - Orient 345 kV is planned to be out of service 2024-12-2 07:00 - 2024-12-20 15:00.
- Takeaway capacity from Orient Wind Farm (400 MW).
- Downstream of Rolling Hills Wind Farm (484 MW) and Southern Hills Wind Farm (254 MW).

SPP line Cooper NPPD - S3458 345 kV has been out since 2024-9-24 09:28, and its outage is planned to end 2024-12-20 14:30.
- Takeaway capacity from Cooper (nuclear-fired, 801 MW) to St. Joseph, MO.
SPP line Cooper NPPD - St. Joe 345 kV has been out since 2024-11-18 08:00, and its outage is planned to end 2024-12-6 16:00.
- Takeaway capacity from Cooper (nuclear-fired, 801 MW) to Omaha, NE.

AECI line Creston - Maryville 161 kV has been out since 2024-10-21, and its outage is planned to end 2025-3-21. The standard flow bias is from Maryville to Creston (from the Southwest to the Northeast). With this line out, flows from White Cloud Wind Project, Clear Creek Wind Farm, and Conception Wind Farm put more pressure on the constraint.

**Generation:**
Sizable wind generation capacity pushes on this constraint.
- Clear Creek Wind Farm (230 MW)
- White Cloud Wind Project (236 MW)
- Adams (MidAmerican) Wind Farm (150 MW)
- Contrail Wind Farm (112 MW)
- Conception Wind Project (50 MW)

**Load:**
St. Joseph, MO, Lee's Summit, MO.

**Line Ratings:**
Historically, the post-contingent rating on Maryville - Midway 161 kV uprates on Oct. 1 from 180 MW to 192 MW and on Dec. 1 from 192 MW to 204 MW.

**Commentary:**
Lake Road (NG peaker, 231 MW) and Iatan (Subbituminous coal, 1.584 GW) are on the high side of the constraint.

### Forward View
Planned outages from 1/13 until the end of January are moderately bearish the constraint. These include SPP line Maryville - Braddyville 161 kV (1/13-2/21) and T61 @ Reil in MHEB (1/12-1/18).

With Both Maryville - Braddyvile 161 kV (SPP) and Creston - Maryville 161 kV (AECI) out from 1/13-2/21, flow patterns in the region will change. While Maryville - Midwary 161 kV FLO Nodway - Gentry - Fairport 161 kV might not be the best constraint to target, it seems likely that another constraint in the region will bind.
