### Forward View
January transmission outages are moderately bearish the constraint for F25 from 1/6-end of month.
- ADAMSMITCH34_1 (2025-01-06 09:00 - 2025-02-14 17:00)
- FREBOHAYWA16_1 (2025-01-06 11:00 - 2025-02-05 10:00)
- EAU_CKING34_1 (2025-01-06 09:00 - 2025-04-22 16:00)

Despite these bearish effects, we still see risk that the constraint binds. Given the cheap MCP for related paths, this could be an opportunity to get long.
