### Drivers
**Topology:**
Chub Lake - Hampton 345 kV was out 2024-11-18 09:41 - 2024-11-22 16:56. The constraint bound 90%+ of the time during this outage.

**Generation:**
Wind generation to the West and Southwest
- [[Odell Wind Farm]] (200 MW)
- [[Palo Alto Wind Farm]] (340 MW)
- [[Nobles Wind Farm]] (451 MW)
- [[Blazing Star Wind Farm]] (400 MW)

[[Mankato Energy Center]] (NG CC, 741 MW)

**Load:**
Twin Cities.

**Line Ratings:**
SE data indicate that the ratings are static.

**Commentary:**
Ross mentioned a known solution for mitigating congestion -- opening a circuit breaker to prevent ring bus effects.

### Solving Generation
Monticello, Prairie Island, Coal Creek, Sherburne County, Black Dog

### Forward View
Given that the Chub Lake - Hampton 345 kV outage has concluded, our view is that the present constraint will weaken substantially from its November 2024 performance.

With that said, this is a fragile portion of the grid bridging wind generation in the West and Twin Cities load in the East. There's certainly potential for a constraint in the region to bind, but likely not this one.
