### Basic Facts
**Monitored Element:** MONONA MON_AC
- Common Name: Monona transformer
- Voltage: 161/69 kV
- Equipment Type: Transformer
- From Bus: MONONA 5
- To Bus: MONONA 8
- From Zone: [[MidAmerican Energy Company|MEC]]
- To Zone: [[MidAmerican Energy Company|MEC]]
**ISO(s):** [[MISO]]
**Nearby Landmarks:** Battle Creek, IA
**For loss of:** Base
**Direction Bound:** down the transformer from the 161 kV level to the 69 kV level

### Drivers
**Topology:**
There seems to be something here, but we are unsure.

**Generation:**
New Harvest Wind Project, Victory Wind Farm, Carroll Wind Farm

**Line Ratings:**
40 MW branch rating A

**Flow Bias:**
Down the transformer.

**Commentary:**
High wind output from the above wind farms is necessary for the constraint to bind. However, it's unclear what the sufficient conditions for binding are.
