### Drivers
**Topology:**
Werner West - Rocky Run 345 kV was out 2024-12-17 08:19 - 2024-12-19 10:51.

**Generation:**
Point Beach (1,286 MW, nuclear)
Elm Road (1,403 MW, coal)
Edgewater (414 MW, coal)

Weston (945 MW, coal) is on the high side.

**Line Ratings:**
Static 143 MW post-contingent line rating.

**Flow Bias:**
Roughly 70% of the time, flows are up the transformer from the 115 kV level to the 138 kV level (in the opposite direction of the constraint). The remaining 30% of the time, flows are down the transformer in the direction of the constraint.
