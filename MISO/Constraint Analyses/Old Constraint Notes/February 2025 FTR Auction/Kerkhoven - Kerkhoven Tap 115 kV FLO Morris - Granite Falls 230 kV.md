### Drivers
**Line Ratings:**
90 MW static post-contingent line rating.

**Flow Bias:**
Northward from Kerkhoven Tap to Kerkhoven.

**Commentary:**
This constraint's bind rate is so low, that it's hard to determine the drivers beyond Northward flows. When it does bind, it does so at high shadow prices.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
Similar pricing as Z24 and F24 historical prices.

### Highest Exposure Paths
We don't recommend a position targeting this constraint, since its natural paths have substantial volatility, and the drivers aren't clear.
