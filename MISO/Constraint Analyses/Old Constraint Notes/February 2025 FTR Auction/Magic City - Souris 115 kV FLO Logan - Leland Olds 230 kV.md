### Drivers
**Topology:**
The following outage cluster in mid-November - mid December, 2024 was bullish the constraint:
- LELANANTEL34_1 1
- LELANANTEL34_2 1
- LELANDO_CHAPEL A
- LELALELAN34_2 S

**Generation:**
New Frontier Wind (100 MW) has a 20% GSF. Milton R Young (448 MW) has a 3% GSF.

**Line Ratings:**
Uprated from 146 MW to 180 MW on 2024-11-15. Uprated from 180 MW to 190 MW on 2024-12-12. Derated from 190 to 181 MW on 2024-12-18.

**Flow Bias:**
Exclusively from Magic City to Souris

**Commentary:**
Historically, this constraint has bound most often when its post-contingent line rating was low (146 MW). It has bound when the line rating was at the 180 MW level in late November, 2024 and during one period in December, 2024.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
No planned outages in GH25 appear to have a material effect on the constraint.

This feels like a case in which, from an expected value perspective, shorting would be wise. However, one would need to be okay with the tail risk.
