#### Summary Characterization
Chronic constraint driven by Southward wind transfer. More localized to Omaha load (pulling) and Sioux City-area wind generation than Raun - Ft. Calhoun, which is at the 345 kV level (and hence more so of a macro play).
### Basic Facts
**Monitored Element:** RAUNTEKAM16_1 1
- Common Name: Raun - Tekamah
- Voltage: 161 kV

**ISO(s):** [[MISO]], [[SPP]]
**Nearby Landmarks:** Sioux City, IA; Omaha, NE
**For loss of:** MECOPP1
1. FT_CARAUN34_1 1
    - Common Name: Fort Calhoun - Raun

### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Line Ratings:** ratings fluctuate from 217 MW to 284 MW (both post-contingent). These appear to be seasonal ratings. SPP's state estimator ratings for the line look to be incorrect. Need to look at FFEs to get a better idea for the rating ground truth.

**Flow Bias:**
Southward from Raun to Tekamah, though flow can reverse. Roughly 70% of the time, flows are southward.

**Low-Side Generation:**
Wind generation to the North, East, and West.

**High-Side Generation:**
- Lon Wright (130 MW coal ST, 40 MW NG GT, 2 MW solar)

**Load:**
Omaha, NE.

**Transmission Outages:**
- Tekamah - Oakland 161 kV
