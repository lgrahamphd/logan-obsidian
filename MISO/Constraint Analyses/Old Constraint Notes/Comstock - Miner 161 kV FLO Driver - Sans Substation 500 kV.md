### Binding Events and Drivers
**J25**
- Kelso Lutesville 345 kV outage.
- Lutesville - Essex 345 kV (NMAD-LUTS-1) outage.
- New Madrid - Essex 345 kV outage.
- Essex XF 345/161 kV ([[AECI]] equipment) outage.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
Kelso - Lutesville 345 kV is out over the following periods:
- 6/2-6/6/25
- 10/28-11/10/25
- 4/1-4/22/26
The Kelso - Lutesville 345 kV outage is bullish, but we're unconvinced that this outage alone will drive a binding event. Lutesville - Essex 345 kV outages appear to be a more effectual driver.

We see limited value for Comstock - Miner over the 2025-26 PY.
