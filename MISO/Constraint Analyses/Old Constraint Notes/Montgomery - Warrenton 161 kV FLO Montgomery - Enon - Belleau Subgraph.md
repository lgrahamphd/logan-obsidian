### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Line Ratings:**
Seasonal, dynamic.
- Winter (roughly October 15-April 15): 335-355 MW post-contingent. Note: there appears to be flexibility as to when the winter uprate occurs. In 2024, it was dynamically uprated and derated several times before the "final" winter uprate on 11/13/2024.
- Summer (roughly April 16-October 15):  297-339 MW post-contingent.

**Flow Bias:**
Eastward from Montgomery to Warrenton.

**Transmission Outages:**
- Bland - Franks 345 kV
- Labadie - Bland 345 kV
- Labadie - Mason 345 kV
- Labadie - Montgomery 345 kV
- Montgomery - McCredie 345 kV

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Callaway County (1.23 GW, nuclear)
- Envoy Solar (50 MW)
- Thomas Hill Energy Center (1.18 GW, subbituminous coal, ST)
- Wolf Creek (1.3 GW, nuclear)

**High-Side Generation:**
- Blue Bird Solar Farm (139 MW)
- Labadie (2.39 GW, subbituminous coal, ST)

**Load:**
- Wentzville, MO
- Warrenton, MO
- St. Louis, MO
