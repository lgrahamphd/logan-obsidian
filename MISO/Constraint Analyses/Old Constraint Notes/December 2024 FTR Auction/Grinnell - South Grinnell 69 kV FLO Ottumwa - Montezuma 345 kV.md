1. OTTUMMNTZU34_1 1
    - Common Name: Ottumwa - Montezuma
    - Voltage: 345 kV
	- Equipment Type: Transmission line
    - From Bus: OTTUMWA3
    - To Bus: MONTEZUMA 3
**Direction Bound:** Forward; from Grinnell to South Grinnell

### History
Bound $41.8$ hours in RT from Oct. 1 - Nov. 10, 2024 at a $\$35.98/MWh$ average. Has not bound in RT since 2024-10-17 10:45.

### Drivers
**Topology:**
The in-series lines Poweshiek - Reasnor 161 kV and Poweshiek - Irvine 161 kV were out of service 2024-9-20 08:18 - 2024-10-18 11:25. With these lines out, the only North-to-South transmission available above the 69 kV level is Ottumwa - Montezuma 345 kV, the monitored element. This 161 kV path's return to service coincided with the cessation of the present constraint binding in RT. Binding in the DAM ceased shortly thereafter.

**Line Ratings:**
Historical data indicate a Nov. 1 seasonal uprate from 74 MW to 85 MW.

### Solving Generation
- English Farms 1 (172 MW)
- Ottumwa (725 MW, subbituminous coal)
- Prairie Wind Farm (168 MW)

### Forward View
December planned transmission outages are relatively unimpactful for the present constraint, except for the 8-hour in-series Diamondback - Montezuma 345 kV and Bondurant - Montezuma 345 kV scheduled maintenance 2024-12-29 08:00 - 2024-12-29 16:00 (the status for this planned outage is "Study"). With the Reasnor - Poweshiek - Irvine 161 kV line back in service, our view is that the risk of this constraint binding is low.
