### History
Bound $101.1$ hours in RT from Oct. 1 - Nov. 7, 2024 at a $\$66.98/MWh$ average.

### Drivers
**Generation:**
Oahe Dam; surrounding wind generation; Big Bend Dam

**Line Ratings:**
On Nov. 1, the monitored element uprates from 238 MW to 394 MW, a 65% increase. When the line rating is at 238 MW, risk that the constraint binds is chronic.

### Forward View
Since the Nov. 1 uprate, neither MISO nor SPP have seen the present constraint bind. There is still some lingering DA congestion on both sides, but we expect that to quickly converge with RT (to zero) - presuming no major outages.

There are some mildly bullish transmission outages planned for 12/16-12/19. However, given their brief duration and weak bullish effects, they fail to move the needle.
