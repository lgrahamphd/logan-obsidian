#### Summary Characterization
Transmission outage-driven. Needs both Thomas Hill to be running and a bullish transmission outage to bind. When this binds, it's sticky, as MISO lacks control over the drivers (AECI).

### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Branch Ratings:**
Winter (Oct. 15 - Apr. 15):
- 290 MW post-contingent rating.
Summer (Apr. 15 - Oct. 15):
- 242 MW post-contingent rating.
AMMO has a history of adjusting the ratings "live."
- Summer rating persisted until 11/15 in 2024.
- Single-day uprates have occurred in the late summer.
- QV22 saw daily ratings fluctuations.

**Flow Bias:**
Southward from Moberly to Overton 95% of the time.

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Thomas Hill can push ~230 MW on the constraint.
- Columbia Energy Center

**High-Side Generation:**
- Labadie
- Osage

**Load:**
The 161 kV network in Central Missouri is on the high side of several constraints, including the present one. Also note the Overton transformer constraint.

### Binding Events and Drivers
**JK25**
- Bolstad - Rebel 161 kV outage, limiting Southward flows along the 161 kV network.
- Fabi - Zachary 345 kV outage.
- Maywood - Fabi 345 kV outage.
- Stopped binding once Thomas Hill took a 738 MW outage beginning 4/21/25. Typically needs Thomas Hill's push.
**U22**
- KCPL - Overton 345 kV tie line outage, which cut off Eastward flows from Sibley along the 345 kV network.
**H21**
- Norton - Salisbury 161 kV outage, limiting Southward flows along the 161 kV network.
