### Basic Facts
**Monitored Element:** OTTUMWA T1
- Common Name: OTTUMWA Transformer
- Voltage: 345/161 kV
- Equipment Type: Transformer
- From Bus: OTTUMWA5
- To Bus: OTTUMWA3
- From Zone: [[Alliant West|ALTW]]

1. HILLSDIAMN34_1 1
    - Common Name: Hills - Diamond Trail
    - Voltage: 345 kV
	- Equipment Type: Transmission line
    - From Bus: HILLS
    - To Bus: DIAMOND TRL3
**Direction Bound:** down the transformer -- from the 345 kV level to the 161 kV level

---
### Drivers
**Topology:**
Very much outage-driven. ZACH_HUGH_5944 A drove the November, 2024 binding event. The constraint has not bound outside of this outage window.

**Generation:**
Diamond Trail Wind Farm, North English Wind Farm.

**Line Ratings:**
Static post-contingent line ratings at 637 MW.

**Flow Bias:**
Bidirectional flow (both up the transformer and down the transformer) is common.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
Very low probability of binding in H25.
Zachary - Maywood 345 kV outage from 2025-03-31 08:00 - 2025-04-11 16:00 is strongly bullish.
