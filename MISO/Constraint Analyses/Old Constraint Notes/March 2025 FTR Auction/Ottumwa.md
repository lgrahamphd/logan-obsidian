### Summary
Ottumwa is due for a maintenance and inspection outage. However, IIR struggles to estimate such outages, so the market is likely incorrect in its estimation of the outage timeline.

Moreover, the recency of the [[MISO/Constraint Analyses/Old Constraint Notes/December 2024 FTR Auction/Grinnell - South Grinnell 69 kV FLO Ottumwa - Montezuma 345 kV]] constraint (which bound heavily in V24) could scare the market off from sinking at ALTW.GRCT.ARR (and overall, percolate mispricing in the region).
