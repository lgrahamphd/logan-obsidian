### Ratings, Flows, Generation, and Load
**Line Ratings:**
Dynamic line rating ranging from 376 MW to 587 MW (both post-contingent). In late March/early April in the past, the post-contingent rating has been in the low-mid 400s.

**Flow Bias:**
Southward, from Kokomo to Tipton.

**Transmission Outages:**
- The PSI_69134A 1, PSI_6943A 1, PSI_6943B 1 triplet of 69 kV outages could restrict Southward flow. Unsure how impactful this is given the low voltage levels.

**Low-Side Generation:**
- Hardy Hills Solar (195 MW) can push up to 25 MW on the constraint.
- Indiana Crossroads Solar Farm (200 MW)
- Nukes push (Cook, Braidwood, LaSalle, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, Quad Cities).
- Cayuga can push up to 25 MW.
- Wind in Western IN can push ~25 MW.

**High-Side Generation:**
- Noblesville (283 MW, NG CC, MISO unit).
- Anderson (169 MW, NG GT, PJM unit)

**Load:**
- Indianapolis, IN.

### Fair Value Modeling Notes
Peak should be much more valuable than Off-peak due to solar push.
