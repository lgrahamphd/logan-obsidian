The *ex-ante [[Locational Marginal Price]]* is an LMP that respects the physical and operational limitations of all generation and transmission facilities. This is in contrast to the [[Ex-Post LMP]], which does not necessarily respect the physical limit of fast start resources or emergency operations resources activated during emergency procedures.

Ex-ante LMPs are specific to [[MISO]].
