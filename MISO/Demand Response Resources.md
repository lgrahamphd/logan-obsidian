### Type I Demand Response Resources (DRR-Type I)
DRR-Type I is an asset type reserved for those resources that provide a specific amount of energy or contingency reserve into the MISO market through physical load interruption.
#### Requirements
- Registered to participate in the Energy and Operating Reserve Markets.
- Capable of supplying a *specific quantity* of energy, *contingency* reserves, or capacity at the choice of the Market Participant to the Energy and Operating Reserve Market through Behind-the-Meter Generation and/or controllable load.
- Capable of complying with the Transmission Provider's instructions.
- Has the appropriate metering equipment installed.

In the network model, DRR-Type I-capable load is modeled as regular load.
#### Examples
Industrial interruptible load, retail load reduction

### Type II Demand Response Resources (DRR-Type II)
DRR-Type II is an asset type reserved for those resources that supply a range of energy and/or operating reserves once registered in the MISO energy and operating reserve market.
#### Requirements
- Registered to participate in the Energy and Operating Reserve Markets.
- Capable of supplying a *range* of energy, *operating* reserves, *up-ramp capability and/or down-ramp capability*, or capacity at the choice of the market participant to the Energy and Operating Reserve Market through Behind-the-Meter Generation and/or controllable load.
- Capable of complying with the Transmission Provider's instructions.
- Has the appropriate metering equipment installed.

In the network model, DRR-Type II-capable load is modeled as a single generation resource. This resource would typically operate in the negative range ($<0$ MW) to reflect its characteristics as dispatchable load.

#### Examples
Behind-the-meter generation that is capable of receiving electronic dispatch instructions.
