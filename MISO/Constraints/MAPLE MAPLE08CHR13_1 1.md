### Drivers
- GREENTOW 1 is an outaged 765/138 kV transformer with Abs LCDF 4.4%
	- Retired 11/30/2022
- Constraint bound as flows were trying to make it down to Indianapolis, downstream of supply from Cook, Braidwood, and LaSalle -> 765 kV lines -> Greentown -> 138 kV and lower lines
- Constraint bound as load picked up while several 69 kV lines around and South of Kokomo were out.
### Forward View
It appears that there is a systemic risk of getting flow onto lower kV lines flowing into Indianapolis from the North. The Greentown 765/138 kV transformer has retired.
