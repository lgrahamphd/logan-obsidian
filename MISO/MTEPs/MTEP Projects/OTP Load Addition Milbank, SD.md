### Project Description
This project replaces the withdrawn Milbank project with ID #23936 as a scope change prompted a new project; this is the new correct project.

OTP has received a new load request in Milbank, SD. In order to serve this new load a new 115 kV line will be constructed from Big Stone 230/115 kV substation to Milbank, SD where a new 115/12.5 kV substation will be built. The new 115 kV line will utilize the existing 41.6 kV route, therefore the existing 41.6 kV lines around Milbank will be removed and the Milbank NW distribution substation will be converted from the 41.6 kV system to the 115 kV system.

An additional 115 kV line will be built from the new Milbank, SD substation to a new 115 kV switching station that will be located on the Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV line. Part of this line will utilize the existing 41.6 kV route, therefore the 41.6 kV line will be removed and the Milbank South distribution substation will be converted from the 41.6 kV to the 115 kV system.

The facilities will consist of the following:
- [x] Expansion of the Big Stone 115 kV bus to accommodate an additional 115 kV terminal.
- [x] Approximate 12.5-mile 115 kV line from Big Stone 115 kV to a new Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation, leveraging mainly the existing 41.6 kV route.
- [x] A new Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation and conversion of the Milbank NW distribution substation to the 115 kV.
- [ ] Approximate 18.5-mile 115 kV line from the new Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation to a new switching station located on the Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV line.
- [ ] A new tap along the 15-mile 115 kV to convert the Milbank South substation to the 115 kV system.
- [ ] A new 115 kV switching station on the Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV line.
#### Short Explanation
1. New Milbank 115 kV substation to serve the new load.
2. Tap Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV by adding a breaker-only substation.
3. New 115 kV line from the Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV tap to the new Milbank 115 kV station.
### System Need
New load requested in Milbank, SD. The existing 41.6 kV system that serves Milbank and the surrounding area is no longer sufficient.
### Status
##### Completed Facilities
- The Big Stone 115 kV bus expansion was completed 11/6/24.
- The Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation construction was completed 12/20/24.
- The 12-12.5 mile 115 kV line from Big Stone 115 kV to the new Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation was completed 12/13/24.
##### Facilities Under Construction
- A new 115 kV breaker station along the Big Stone - Marietta 115 kV line. Expected ISD: 12/31/26.
##### Approved Facilities
- A new tap to convert the Milbank South substation from the 41.6 kV system to the 115 kV system. This tap will occur on the new 115 kV line between the new Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation and the new breaker station on the Big Stone to Marietta 115 kV line. Expected ISD: 12/31/26.
- Construct a new approximate 18.5-mile 115 kV line from Milbank 115/12.5 kV substation to a new breaker station on the Big Stone - Milbank 115 kV line. The new 115 kV line will utilize a portion of the existing 41.6 kV route where the 41.6 kV line will be removed. Expected ISD: 12/31/26.
