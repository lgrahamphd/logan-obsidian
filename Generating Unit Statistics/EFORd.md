Equivalent Demand Forced Outage Rate (EFORd)

EFORd is the probability (in percent) that a generating unit will not (or did not) meet its required generation demanded by dispatch.

The statistic comes from NERC's Generating Availability Data System (GADs), which provides annual operational statistics by unit type and size from NERC's annual survey of plant operators.
